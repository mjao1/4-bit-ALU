# 4bit-ALU-Basys3
A 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) built at gate level abstraction. The 4-bit ALU is developed and implemented using Verilog in Xilinx Vivado, deploying it on the Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA. The ALU features 16 arithmetic and logic operation selections and accepts two 4-bit inputs from switches 0-7 and a 4-bit operation selector from switches 8-11 on the Basys 3. The results are outputted via onboard LEDs as a binary representation.
